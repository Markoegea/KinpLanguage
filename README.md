# KinpLanguage
This is a project to create a programming lenguage with a syntaxis in spanish, based in Python with inspiration in JavaScript and C#
But there are things to add and upgrade:
* Error handling.
* Lists.
* Condition (Switch).
* Cycles (for, while, do-while).
* Classes.

> In the folder "examples" you will find some files with exercises made in Kinp

## To open it you have to write in the console:
In linux
``` console
python3 main.py (the path of your file .kp)
```
In Windows
``` console
py main.py (the path of your file .kp)
```

For example 
``` console
python3 main.py examples/factorial_2.kp
```
